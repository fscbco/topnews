    # Rob Note: to avoid creating user_faves and other_faves I debated created a query object

    #           https://gist.github.com/dabobert/7470f62d3ab2b704a2213595eb8a07a7
    #           but due to the time constraints and the added complexity
    #           I decided to go with the current implementation

    @stories     = Post.includes(:post_author).desc_stories.paginate(page:, per_page:)
