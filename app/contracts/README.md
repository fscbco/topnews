# Contracts

This is a non standard rails folder that was created to store contracts for external data interactions
Strong parameters is extremely limited in its ability to validate incoming data. We use dry-validation
to create more comprehensive and robust validation for incoming data
Files here are used in controllers before processing is done
Files have the name format [controllermodel]_[action]_contract.rb
