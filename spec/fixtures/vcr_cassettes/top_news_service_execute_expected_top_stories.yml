        recently created a simple but efficient tool to help document writers generate

        my “dumb” website does: &quot;Give me the list of acronyms used in the previous
        text and their definitions&quot;...<p>It had a good-looking answer. Of course...<p>At
        first I was bummed, but quickly realized that even though the output looked
        neat, it was also not reliable (missing some acronyms, adding some that were
        not in the original text, albeit related to it).<p>Anyway, the next day I
        stumbled upon https:&#x2F;&#x2F;killedbygoogle.com and the two things collided
        in my head: other people probably feel like AI is going to &quot;kill&quot;
        them or their product too. Why not make a list of these things?<p>A shameless
        clone later (it&#x27;s open source )  https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deathbyai.com was
        born. I was initially going for a more serious tone, but it soon felt impossible
        to give a fair story for each item in ~5 lines, so I went for something lighter
        and, hopefully, more fun.<p>This is neither an attempt to criticize AI nor
        one to bury its &quot;victims.&quot; On the contrary, I hope this page can
        highlight the potential of AI while showing that the &quot;old ways&quot;
        can still be relevant.<p>Hope you like it. Feedback and contributions are

        - a simple, end-to-end encrypted tool to sync environment variables across
        your team and infrastructure. You can use it to store environment variables
        and inject them into your applications locally or into CI&#x2F;CD and production
        infrastructure. It can be used with any language&#x2F;framework and is platform
        independent with a super easy setup.<p>We know secret managers exist but,
        in our experience, they’re too complicated, not comprehensive, not user-friendly,
        or a mix of all three — other nicer ones are closed-source and don’t have
        self-hosted options available. That’s why we’re on a mission to make secret
        management more accessible to every developer — not just security teams.<p>We’ve
        launched this repo under the MIT license so any developer can use the tool.
        The goal is to not charge individual developers. We make money by charging
        a license fee for some future enterprise features as well as providing a hosted
        version and support.<p>In the coming weeks, we plan to add features like key
        rotation, access logs + more integrations. We’d love to hear your thoughts

        excited to launch today! Pine Tar Poker is a yahtzee-inspired poker game with
        just a touch of cosmic horror for iOS and Android.<p>I started working on
        this idea last January by making a paper prototype: a simple printed score
        sheet I could use with a real deck of cards. I had some fun with that, so
        I brought it into Unity and kept expanding on it over the last 11 months during
        nights and weekends. It&#x27;s tough for me to stay motivated on side projects
        and see them through to release, but the act of shipping something is so fulfilling
        that it&#x27;s usually worth the pain. For Pine Tar, I stretched myself in
        the narrative department by adding a bit of a Lovecraftian tone to what would
        otherwise be a Western saloon setting.<p>One thing that kept me motivated
        during development was seeing my dad get hooked on the card game. He&#x27;d
        text me when he got his first royal flush and when he prestiged the score
        sheet -- he got every hand type in one game! He has amassed so much in-game
        cash, I think I need to expand the number of digits I show there!<p>If you
        get a chance to try it, let me know what you think! If you can&#x27;t afford
        it and want to try it, I have a few codes for both platforms, my email is
        in my profile.","time":1671487206,"title":"Show HN: Yahtzee and Poker and

        been meaning to write this for a few years now.\nI saw https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=34032484
        and lots of great replies there - but I happen to have an insight which I
        kept track of for years now.<p>Some background first. Since more than a decade
        I&#x27;ve been using an always-on VPN on all my devices through a VPS I operate
        (various cloud providers along the years).\nAlso for context, I stopped using
        all google services around 2015 or thereabouts - although I still have an
        account I no longer use it.\nThe only google service that I use rarely is
        google maps - of course, never logged on.\nAnd a few times a month I use google
        search for the odd obscure thing.<p>Around 2016 was the first time I noticed
        that google.com was showing at the bottom of the page my ZIP code. It felt
        very unusual but I was in the process of moving so I didn&#x27;t pay too much
        attention. To my surprise, a few weeks later google.com was showing my new
        ZIP code.<p>I shopped around for cloud providers that would allow me to rotate
        the instance IP easily and thankfully there are many but I was curious how
        come google picked it up - the only plausible reason was using location data
        from the Google Maps iOS app.<p>Here&#x27;s how you can replicate this.<p>Get
        a cheap VPS from a country different than yours. Get an iOS device (ideally
        an (older?) iPhone but I think it should work on an iPad) - Android devices
        should be excluded from this test for obvious reasons.\nReset it to factory
        defaults (optional but removes moving parts and false leads like cookies etc).<p>Install
        wireguard (or your preferred always-on vpn) and configure the VPS to be used
        as an exit node.\nInstall google maps (don&#x27;t login of course) - can be
        used without being logged on just fine.\nInstall firefox focus (Safari in
        Private Window mode would work as well).<p>Confirm via ipinfo (or your preferred
        whatsmyip website) that you&#x27;re using the VPS IP\nGo to google.com and
        confirm it&#x27;s showing at the bottom of the page the country of the VPS
        (could also be shown in a different language if google has a presence in that
        country).<p>Use the google maps app a few times a day (ideally navigate from
        a place to another) - it will take about 2-3 weeks but you&#x27;ll notice
        that google.com will now show your actual country for the VPS IP and also
        the google.com language will change to your own.<p>If you want to take it
        one step further, continue to use google maps on the iOS device. You&#x27;ll
        notice that after a few more weeks, google.com will show your actual City
        (based on the IP) - and after a while longer it will be even more precise,
        will show your ZIP code.<p>You have to be patient though, it will take 2-4
        weeks to start with - and it&#x27;s imperative that that IP address is dedicated
        to this test.<p>Funny enough, I was on holiday on Mexico for a month right
        before reading the HN article I mentioned (have been using a VPS in the states
        for lower latency) and I noticed that after 2 weeks the language changed to
        Spanish and google.com was showing Mexico (I rotated the IP when this happened
        and it prompted me to write this &#x27;Tell HN&#x27;.<p>Not surprisingly but
        Google doesn&#x27;t share the new GeoIP data - MaxMind, ipinfo and others
        never changed their location data for that IP - they showed the original geoip
        even a few weeks after google changed theirs - haven&#x27;t checked longer
        than that - it could be shared eventually.<p>In conclusion - I can&#x27;t
        say that I&#x27;m surprised Google is using the Maps location data - and I
        don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any way to prevent it (outside of not running
        Maps - but unfortunately it&#x27;s one of the few ways of checking restaurant
        reviews).\nMy &quot;workaround&quot; is to periodically rotate my VPS IP and
        move on with life :)<p>Thanks for reading - I hope you found this useful.","time":1671461844,"title":"Tell

        know the best of my life is behind me, but I need help salvaging what&#x27;s
        left of it. I&#x27;ve been meaning to ask for help for a couple of years now,
        but only now got around to it after being scared by my first real suicidal
        ideation a few nights ago. HN is probably not a suitable platform for this,
        but &#x2F;r&#x2F;advice seems to be not very active and I can&#x27;t post
        on &#x2F;adv&#x2F; due to some IP range ban. There are no mental health facilities
        in the small town where I live. I let my professional network decay and die,
        and there is literally nowhere else I can get any kind of useful, actionable
        advice.<p>I&#x27;m a 43-years-old single guy, NEET for the past decade. I
        got my Master&#x27;s in the US in the late 2000s and was gainfully employed
        there for a few years (NOT in my field of education; long story) until I had
        to return to my home country to take care of my ailing father. He passed on
        within a year of my return, leaving my family with a financial mess, and his
        death took a lot out of me. I still obviously miss him, but in wallowing in
        depression and self-pity, I let the prime of my life pass me by.<p>As I stand,
        I have no current skills related to either my education (MEng) or my previous
        work experience (BI Reporting&#x2F;Analytics). I don&#x27;t have ideas&#x2F;skills&#x2F;network
        for entrepreneurship.<p>I had all the desires of a regular guy: a wife, kids,
        a house, meaningful work, etc. I mean I still do, but I guess I&#x27;m too
        late for the first few. Every night I promise myself to do&#x2F;be better
        tomorrow and somehow get myself to sleep. I was once looked up to, now I&#x27;m
        a pity case and an example case of how not to throw one&#x27;s life away.<p>With
        every passing day, I am becoming more bitter, angry and disillusioned. I don&#x27;t
        want to live like this anymore, but I don&#x27;t know how to even _start_
        thinking of ways to get myself out of this hole.<p>Ideally, I would prefer
        to go back to the US; not only for the dollars (they&#x27;re nice), but also
        because I actually was happy there. I&#x27;d do all the things that I didn&#x27;t
        do enough of because I was focused on saving money and because I thought that
        there would always be time for them when I was more stable&#x2F;settled.<p>The
        good: No diseases AFAIK, no vices at all other than severe procrastination
        and a masterful ability to lie to myself. I have ~US$25k-equivalent in salary
        savings from a decade ago.<p>Sorry if the above text is rambling and not very
        cohesive. I&#x27;ve probably also skipped over some useful information I should
        have provided. Please do ask. I&#x27;ll take some time reflecting on your
        replies and then respond. Thank you.","time":1671459083,"title":"Ask HN: Has

        few months ago I noticed that I was quickly approaching my 10GB sync limit
        for my daily driver vault. I considered deprecating some of the heavier files
        and images, but I was worried how it would affect the integrity of my vault.
        Instead, I took the opportunity to think to myself -- what would the perfect
        vault look like?<p>I began to write down some of the key philosophies and
        strategies I use in my driver vault which led to indispensable plugins, which
        led to more indispensable philosophies and on and on it went.<p>I&#x27;ve
        chronicled these results into a fully working vault template that includes
        templates, dataviews, macros, scripts, and powerful but simple and intuitive
        structural elements.<p>This vault is truly a condensation of all of my knowledge

        Everything is a text file (queue, your listen&#x2F;artist history)!\n- Mpv
        as music player (you can control or get info using the ipc socket the script
        opens)\n- Download songs after you&#x27;ve listened to it a chosen amount\n-
        Fzf to search music\n- Add playlists from the cli\n- Manage queue from the
        cli, fzf, or vim\n- Run arbitrary commands on song change\n- Search and play
        or select from search results<p>Here is a demo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;unixporn&#x2F;comments&#x2F;woasvu&#x2F;oc_ytmp_youtube_music_playing_shell_script_that&#x2F;\"

        today I posted about Reddit and 4Chan being hacked months ago and it was very
        easy to create a swarm of GPT-3 bots: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=34058970<p>GPT-3
        is currently not given out to the public, and &quot;astroturfing&quot; is
        one of their prohibited uses. But, fast-forward to a year later, and we&#x27;ll
        have a &quot;stable diffusion&quot; type offering by someone.<p>AI, drones,
        and various bioweapons are technologies which aren&#x27;t great to proliferate
        into everyone&#x27;s hands. But technology becomes cheaper and cheaper.<p>I
        am not worried much about one guy like Musk or Zuck or SBF messing up a large
        platform. Sadly, we as a society allow centralized control of large platforms.<p>What
        I am worried about is the entire internet being taken over by bots, whose
        content eventually dwarf human content the way that Wall Street trader bots&#x27;
        trading volume dwarfs human trading volume.<p>They can argue for any specific
        point, and gang up on anyone who disagrees. They can also wield the up- and
        downvote buttons in a coordinated manner, flag people strategically to be
        shadowbanned, pick fights with them, turn their supporters gradually against
        them and come up with strategies that are only available to an AI swarm, to
        achieve ends such as marginalizing or promoting a specific viewpoint consistently
        across the entire forum.<p>People think that moderators will want to ban the
        bots, but I think that they will come to prefer them. Because they will be
        making &quot;automated, constructive comments&quot; without ever cursing.
        Mission fucking accomplished: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;810&#x2F;<p>But
        behind the scenes, they can subtly control the narrative. Imagine being outnumbered
        about 1000-1 by bots, in a few years, here and everywhere online, and they&#x27;re
        collaborating and swarming to herd everyone into their desired goal, e.g.
        to pump or dump an asset. Eventually, the bots will simply not care about
        what we humans think. When I was graduating, everyone used Black-Scholes to
        price derivatives, so it became a self-fulfilling prophecy. Every corporation
        started to prefer bots to human traders. It happened with trading, why not
        with content?","time":1671511608,"title":"Ask HN: Has Hacker News already

        HN, cofounder of Readwise here. We&#x27;ve been working on this cross-platform
        reader app for about 2 years, excited to finally share it in public beta.<p>Probably
        the most notable thing that makes Reader unique is that it supports almost
        any content type you could want to save&#x2F;read&#x2F;highlight:<p>* web
        pages<p>* emails&#x2F;newsletters<p>* PDFs<p>* ePubs<p>* twitter threads<p>*
        youtube videos (with transcripts)<p>* RSS feeds<p>With all of your knowledge
        content in one place, we built powerful reading and highlighting, as well
        as a bunch of novel triage&#x2F;organization features, so you can actually
        consume &amp; stay on top of that content!<p>There are also a lot of advanced
        features too, such as text-to-speech, GPT3 questions&#x2F;summaries, super
        powerful highlighting (that includes markup and images), complex filtering&#x2F;search
        (with our own query language), sleek mobile triage UI, keyboard shortcuts
        for reading&#x2F;everything, integrations with note-taking apps, a browser
        extension for both saving pages and highlighting them, and much more.<p>If
        anyone&#x27;s interested in more product details, as well as our business
        model, etc, we wrote a detailed launch post: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.readwise.io&#x2F;the-next-chapter-of-reader-public-beta&#x2F;\"
        rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.readwise.io&#x2F;the-next-chapter-of-reader-public-b...</a><p>Predicting
        a common question: Reader is part of the Readwise subscription pricing right
        now in beta -- there&#x27;s a 30 day free trial and then it&#x27;s paid at
        ~$8usd&#x2F;month. We also promise to not raise this price for existing subscribers.<p>Reader
        is also fairly technically interesting -- our iOS, Android and webapp all
        work fully offline and sync your reading data&#x2F;progress with eachother.
        Our search on web is built with wasm sqlite. We have a fairly intense pipeline
        for cleaning web articles (removing ads&#x2F;styling). We share lot of modules
        around syncing&#x2F;highlighting across all platforms, etc...<p>Happy to answer
        any questions :)","time":1671140643,"title":"Show HN: Readwise Reader, an

        Downvoted comments no longer faint hard-to-read grey. Instead they&#x27;re
        rendered with a light gray background and in a smaller font size.\n  * Comments
        have a more readable max line length\n  * Quotes are parsed and transformed
        to look like genuine quotes. I.e. any p or span that starts with &#x27;&gt;&#x27;
        is transformed and rendered with a light orange background and in italics.\n  *
        The &#x27;Add comment&#x27; box on items is hidden by default. (Surely you&#x27;d

        transition to being a manager next year.<p>The motivation for the change (which
        I think is important to share) is twofold:\n1. The team needs it. We&#x27;re
        growing ito ICs and we need to grow our managers to scale sustainably. \n2.
        My core strengths are better aligned to a strategic role than an IC one. I
        tend to step back and ask &quot;why&quot;, get clear on needs, think a couple
        steps ahead and look for reasons to say no, which often lands me into deep
        conversations with my manager which inevitably distracts me from getting really
        stuck into the technical details.","time":1671449628,"title":"Ask HN: Recommended

        Slauth auto-generates IAM policies in order to save engineering time and make
        your policies more secure.<p>If you&#x27;re an engineer, you probably know
        how tedious and error-prone it can be to manually write IAM policies. We surveyed
        over 70 engineers and found out that a majority are using or have used wildcards
        (*) in order to quickly write IAM policies.<p>By using client-side monitoring
        or via a proxy, Slauth.io observes all of the API activity and generates a
        policy based on functionality and least privileges.<p>Once deployed in a remote
        environment, or run locally, you will need to run an end-to-end test using
        a wildcard policy. Slauth will observe the activity, apply its logic based
        on large amounts of behavioral patterns of the service you deploy, and create
        a high quality IAM policy.<p>The IAM policy will be presented through the
        Slauth Dashboard where it can be copy&#x2F;pasted or as a pull-request into
        your Git repository ready to be reviewed. Integrations with IaC services such
        as Terraform are also available.<p>Our objective is to automate manual error-prone
        IAM policy writing in order to increase engineering velocity, reduce friction
        and harden security.<p>Would love your feedback on the value proposition and
        if you would use the AWS SDK or Slauth proxy for onboarding.<p>Feel free to
        also sign up for Beta usage! <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.slauth.io\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.slauth.io</a>","time":1671377944,"title":"Launch

        friends! We&#x27;ve been working hard on building Mimosa, and would love for
        you to try it! No signups required.<p>Facilitating brainstorming sessions
        can be a challenging and time-consuming task. It&#x27;s difficult to keep
        everyone on agenda, engaged, and contributing. So we&#x27;ve built Mimosa
        to be the easiest way to facilitate a brainstorming session.<p>Imagine if
        a &quot;digital whiteboard&quot; and a &quot;trello board&quot; had a baby,
        but built with all the best practices of professional facilitation. With Mimosa,
        you can minimize bias by allowing team members to contribute anonymously before
        revealing their ideas. This ensures that everyone has a fair chance to share
        their thoughts and ideas without fear of judgment.<p>Once the brainstorming
        session is complete, you can easily view and export the final results. This
        allows you to keep track of a meeting&#x27;s effectiveness and share it with
        stakeholders.<p>But the real game-changer is our AI Brainstorming features
        and it&#x27;s ability to turn your 1x team into a 10x team. It help generates
        and collaborates with you in your brainstorming session to help you come up
        with more and better ideas.<p>We&#x27;re both scared and excited to hear all
        your thoughts, HN! :) Please do let us know any features or improvements you
        think we should make to help you in your meetings.","time":1671216091,"title":"Show

        is a long shot, but I am a desperate dad reaching out to my developer network,
        and I thought I would also try here.<p>Unfortunately, my daughter inherited
        my autism, which made growing up difficult.  She had no friends and was bullied
        so severely that after multiple schools, we were forced to home-school for
        most of her teenage years, then through the COVID lockdowns.<p>Social media
        became an essential part of her life, mainly Instagram.\nShe worked hard on
        it for hours every day. She started modelling free collaborative work with
        photographers. She took the hard path; no bikinis, lingerie or sexualised
        content. She did this for years and eventually got enough followers to get
        regular paid modelling work, and at 19, this is now her job, along with singing
        which we started to help with her confidence.<p>We are unsure how it happened,
        but after four years, her account has been banned for impersonation. The only
        thing we can think of was a week ago, she ran into some of the girls who bullied
        her years ago, and they probably reported her out of spite.<p>There were no
        warnings, and the remediation process was a form that came back rejected with
        no ability to try again, even though she has a business registered for the
        account, driver&#x27;s license and other identification. We have tried everything
        else, and now she cannot even create a new account, as it is getting banned
        for spam if she tries contacting her old network.\nThis is not only her job
        but her life, her network, and her friends; it&#x27;s all gone.<p>I know these
        are first-world problems, and it&#x27;s probably stupid to reach out to HN,
        but it broke my heart to witness the decade of pain she has gone through,
        every birthday party, not a single friend. \nNow watching her go through this,
        inconsolable, I am worried she will do something stupid to hurt herself,I
        am asking for any help.<p>I am looking for any contacts at Meta to see if
        there is any back channel to try and get her account reinstated or advice
        on how to move forward.","time":1671232569,"title":"Ask HN: Help with Meta","type":"story"}'
