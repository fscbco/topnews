        the service, what discounts and promotions apply to them, and so on. I also
        need to keep in mind various personal arrangements.<p>Moreover, after sending
        invoices, I have to manually check the transfer of money, sometimes several
        times a day. If the money has not been received from the customer, I personally
        contact them again and check whether the invoice has been lost.<p>I&#x27;m

        ChargeBee or Rainex on top of Stripe. I&#x27;ve looked through Stripe and

        not in the original text, albeit related to it).<p>Anyway, the next day I
        stumbled upon https:&#x2F;&#x2F;killedbygoogle.com and the two things collided

        clone later (it&#x27;s open source )  https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deathbyai.com was

        and, hopefully, more fun.<p>This is neither an attempt to criticize AI nor
        one to bury its &quot;victims.&quot; On the contrary, I hope this page can
        highlight the potential of AI while showing that the &quot;old ways&quot;

        - a simple, end-to-end encrypted tool to sync environment variables across
        your team and infrastructure. You can use it to store environment variables
        and inject them into your applications locally or into CI&#x2F;CD and production
        infrastructure. It can be used with any language&#x2F;framework and is platform
        independent with a super easy setup.<p>We know secret managers exist but,
        in our experience, they’re too complicated, not comprehensive, not user-friendly,
        or a mix of all three — other nicer ones are closed-source and don’t have
        self-hosted options available. That’s why we’re on a mission to make secret
        management more accessible to every developer — not just security teams.<p>We’ve
        launched this repo under the MIT license so any developer can use the tool.
        The goal is to not charge individual developers. We make money by charging
        a license fee for some future enterprise features as well as providing a hosted
        version and support.<p>In the coming weeks, we plan to add features like key
        rotation, access logs + more integrations. We’d love to hear your thoughts
        and any feature requests!<p>Give it a try (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Infisical&#x2F;infisical\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Infisical&#x2F;infisical</a>),

        been meaning to write this for a few years now.\nI saw https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=34032484
        and lots of great replies there - but I happen to have an insight which I
        kept track of for years now.<p>Some background first. Since more than a decade
        I&#x27;ve been using an always-on VPN on all my devices through a VPS I operate
        (various cloud providers along the years).\nAlso for context, I stopped using
        all google services around 2015 or thereabouts - although I still have an
        account I no longer use it.\nThe only google service that I use rarely is
        google maps - of course, never logged on.\nAnd a few times a month I use google
        search for the odd obscure thing.<p>Around 2016 was the first time I noticed
        that google.com was showing at the bottom of the page my ZIP code. It felt
        very unusual but I was in the process of moving so I didn&#x27;t pay too much
        attention. To my surprise, a few weeks later google.com was showing my new
        ZIP code.<p>I shopped around for cloud providers that would allow me to rotate
        the instance IP easily and thankfully there are many but I was curious how
        come google picked it up - the only plausible reason was using location data
        from the Google Maps iOS app.<p>Here&#x27;s how you can replicate this.<p>Get
        a cheap VPS from a country different than yours. Get an iOS device (ideally
        an (older?) iPhone but I think it should work on an iPad) - Android devices
        should be excluded from this test for obvious reasons.\nReset it to factory
        defaults (optional but removes moving parts and false leads like cookies etc).<p>Install
        wireguard (or your preferred always-on vpn) and configure the VPS to be used
        as an exit node.\nInstall google maps (don&#x27;t login of course) - can be
        used without being logged on just fine.\nInstall firefox focus (Safari in
        Private Window mode would work as well).<p>Confirm via ipinfo (or your preferred
        whatsmyip website) that you&#x27;re using the VPS IP\nGo to google.com and
        confirm it&#x27;s showing at the bottom of the page the country of the VPS
        (could also be shown in a different language if google has a presence in that
        country).<p>Use the google maps app a few times a day (ideally navigate from
        a place to another) - it will take about 2-3 weeks but you&#x27;ll notice
        that google.com will now show your actual country for the VPS IP and also
        the google.com language will change to your own.<p>If you want to take it
        one step further, continue to use google maps on the iOS device. You&#x27;ll
        notice that after a few more weeks, google.com will show your actual City
        (based on the IP) - and after a while longer it will be even more precise,
        will show your ZIP code.<p>You have to be patient though, it will take 2-4
        weeks to start with - and it&#x27;s imperative that that IP address is dedicated
        to this test.<p>Funny enough, I was on holiday on Mexico for a month right
        before reading the HN article I mentioned (have been using a VPS in the states
        for lower latency) and I noticed that after 2 weeks the language changed to
        Spanish and google.com was showing Mexico (I rotated the IP when this happened
        and it prompted me to write this &#x27;Tell HN&#x27;.<p>Not surprisingly but
        Google doesn&#x27;t share the new GeoIP data - MaxMind, ipinfo and others
        never changed their location data for that IP - they showed the original geoip
        even a few weeks after google changed theirs - haven&#x27;t checked longer
        than that - it could be shared eventually.<p>In conclusion - I can&#x27;t
        say that I&#x27;m surprised Google is using the Maps location data - and I
        don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any way to prevent it (outside of not running
        Maps - but unfortunately it&#x27;s one of the few ways of checking restaurant
        reviews).\nMy &quot;workaround&quot; is to periodically rotate my VPS IP and
        move on with life :)<p>Thanks for reading - I hope you found this useful.","time":1671461844,"title":"Tell

        excited to launch today! Pine Tar Poker is a yahtzee-inspired poker game with
        just a touch of cosmic horror for iOS and Android.<p>I started working on
        this idea last January by making a paper prototype: a simple printed score
        sheet I could use with a real deck of cards. I had some fun with that, so
        I brought it into Unity and kept expanding on it over the last 11 months during
        nights and weekends. It&#x27;s tough for me to stay motivated on side projects
        and see them through to release, but the act of shipping something is so fulfilling
        that it&#x27;s usually worth the pain. For Pine Tar, I stretched myself in
        the narrative department by adding a bit of a Lovecraftian tone to what would
        otherwise be a Western saloon setting.<p>One thing that kept me motivated
        during development was seeing my dad get hooked on the card game. He&#x27;d
        text me when he got his first royal flush and when he prestiged the score
        sheet -- he got every hand type in one game! He has amassed so much in-game
        cash, I think I need to expand the number of digits I show there!<p>If you
        get a chance to try it, let me know what you think! If you can&#x27;t afford
        it and want to try it, I have a few codes for both platforms, my email is
        in my profile.","time":1671487206,"title":"Show HN: Yahtzee and Poker and

        know the best of my life is behind me, but I need help salvaging what&#x27;s
        left of it. I&#x27;ve been meaning to ask for help for a couple of years now,
        but only now got around to it after being scared by my first real suicidal
        ideation a few nights ago. HN is probably not a suitable platform for this,
        but &#x2F;r&#x2F;advice seems to be not very active and I can&#x27;t post
        on &#x2F;adv&#x2F; due to some IP range ban. There are no mental health facilities
        in the small town where I live. I let my professional network decay and die,
        and there is literally nowhere else I can get any kind of useful, actionable
        advice.<p>I&#x27;m a 43-years-old single guy, NEET for the past decade. I
        got my Master&#x27;s in the US in the late 2000s and was gainfully employed
        there for a few years (NOT in my field of education; long story) until I had
        to return to my home country to take care of my ailing father. He passed on
        within a year of my return, leaving my family with a financial mess, and his
        death took a lot out of me. I still obviously miss him, but in wallowing in
        depression and self-pity, I let the prime of my life pass me by.<p>As I stand,
        I have no current skills related to either my education (MEng) or my previous
        work experience (BI Reporting&#x2F;Analytics). I don&#x27;t have ideas&#x2F;skills&#x2F;network
        for entrepreneurship.<p>I had all the desires of a regular guy: a wife, kids,
        a house, meaningful work, etc. I mean I still do, but I guess I&#x27;m too
        late for the first few. Every night I promise myself to do&#x2F;be better
        tomorrow and somehow get myself to sleep. I was once looked up to, now I&#x27;m
        a pity case and an example case of how not to throw one&#x27;s life away.<p>With
        every passing day, I am becoming more bitter, angry and disillusioned. I don&#x27;t
        want to live like this anymore, but I don&#x27;t know how to even _start_
        thinking of ways to get myself out of this hole.<p>Ideally, I would prefer
        to go back to the US; not only for the dollars (they&#x27;re nice), but also
        because I actually was happy there. I&#x27;d do all the things that I didn&#x27;t
        do enough of because I was focused on saving money and because I thought that
        there would always be time for them when I was more stable&#x2F;settled.<p>The
        good: No diseases AFAIK, no vices at all other than severe procrastination
        and a masterful ability to lie to myself. I have ~US$25k-equivalent in salary
        savings from a decade ago.<p>Sorry if the above text is rambling and not very
        cohesive. I&#x27;ve probably also skipped over some useful information I should
        have provided. Please do ask. I&#x27;ll take some time reflecting on your
        replies and then respond. Thank you.","time":1671459083,"title":"Ask HN: Has

        Hacker News!<p>I&#x27;ve been a long time viewer of the forum but never posted
        anyything but I have appreciated browsing the site every day for a couple
        of years now. This is my first post and my first account. The community has
        inspired me over the years, both in terms of the quality of dicussion given
        and by presenting thoughts and opinions that I&#x27;ve never even considered
        before.<p>Because of this I&#x27;m considering changing my career options
        to Software Engineering or a similar computer science related role. I&#x27;m
        currently a penultimate year business student at a University in the UK. Some
        of my modules have contained the R programming language and small amounts
        of Python. Nothing considerable for the most part but very interesting none
        the less but that&#x27;s as far as my computer science education goes. When
        I finish my bachelors I would like to do a Master Degree (conversion course)
        in Software Development.<p>I&#x27;m 29 years old so I do feel a little bit
        of time-pressure (in terms of what to learn) and my maths skills are lacking,
        since I only have a Math GCSE from school about 11 years ago. For this part,
        usually my coursemates at Uni do the more quanititative parts since I struggle
        alot with this.<p>I&#x27;ve dabbled here and there in Python, R, Bash and
        Lua in my own time, and I&#x27;m not technologically illiterate (I really
        enjoy playing with the UNIX eco-system and I used to build computers as a
        kid) but nothing too major.<p>I didn&#x27;t find &#x27;The Pragmatic Programmer&#x27;
        very helpful, Automate the Boring Stuff on Udemy threw many errors at me and
        felt outdated, and I&#x27;m definitely not ready for &#x27;The Art of Computer
        Programming&#x27;, though I&#x27;ve tried.<p>The problem I&#x27;m facing is,
        no matter the resource I use I just don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m developing
        a deep understanding, or even comprehending what it is I&#x27;m learning.
        I get very overwhelmed by the complexity of it. I&#x27;ve tried doing coding
        books for children and I even find some of those a bit beyond my grasp.<p>Whatever
        resource I use, I ultimately feel like theres just pieces, &#x27;something&#x27;,
        missing, or the explanations aren&#x27;t clear at all, I get frustrated and
        then try again with another resource. I&#x27;m starting to feel like I&#x27;m
        the problem, albeit some of the resources I&#x27;ve used could really do with
        a more rigourous understanding of what &#x27;beginner&#x27; means.<p>Many
        of them tend to be very &#x27;academic&#x27; sounding, much like the maths
        books I&#x27;ve tried and full of complex language or terminology that I don&#x27;t
        understand.<p>Resources I&#x27;ve tried: Codecademy, Datacamp, Udemy (automate
        the boring stuff, Python Bootcamp: Zero to Hero, etc), FreeCodeCamp, TheOdinProject,
        FutureCoder, Python.org, LearnPython.org, learncpp.com, C# for Beginners,
        leetcode, edabit, exercism.io, Code Wars, Code Abbey, Project Euler, Codinggame.com,
        books from NoStarchPress and various other books and youtube videos (e.g.
        FreeCodeCamp Videos).<p>Many of the publications by Manning go right over
        my head, NoStarchPress is good but sometimes assumes the reader knows a lot
        more than I do and video courses like Packt, Treehouse, Udacity and Datacamp
        have varying levels of teaching quality and contain gaps.<p>I feel like everyone
        but me can sort of &#x27;see&#x27; the code in a sort of &#x27;logical&#x27;
        engineering kind of way and that&#x27;s the skill I&#x27;d like to develop.
        Is that possible?<p>I saw &#x27;Thinking in Systems&#x27; by Donella Meadows
        reccomended so I picked the audiobook version of that up and I&#x27;m going
        through that.<p>Should I stick with business? Am I capable of learning these
        things even if I find them overwhelming? Am I the problem? How do I resolve
        this, if I am the problem? What am I not doing that I should be doing?","time":1671547885,"title":"Ask

        Fzf to search music\n- Add playlists from the cli\n- Manage queue from the

        today I posted about Reddit and 4Chan being hacked months ago and it was very
        easy to create a swarm of GPT-3 bots: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=34058970<p>GPT-3
        is currently not given out to the public, and &quot;astroturfing&quot; is
        one of their prohibited uses. But, fast-forward to a year later, and we&#x27;ll
        have a &quot;stable diffusion&quot; type offering by someone.<p>AI, drones,
        and various bioweapons are technologies which aren&#x27;t great to proliferate
        into everyone&#x27;s hands. But technology becomes cheaper and cheaper.<p>I
        am not worried much about one guy like Musk or Zuck or SBF messing up a large
        platform. Sadly, we as a society allow centralized control of large platforms.<p>What
        I am worried about is the entire internet being taken over by bots, whose
        content eventually dwarf human content the way that Wall Street trader bots&#x27;
        trading volume dwarfs human trading volume.<p>They can argue for any specific
        point, and gang up on anyone who disagrees. They can also wield the up- and
        downvote buttons in a coordinated manner, flag people strategically to be
        shadowbanned, pick fights with them, turn their supporters gradually against
        them and come up with strategies that are only available to an AI swarm, to
        achieve ends such as marginalizing or promoting a specific viewpoint consistently
        across the entire forum.<p>People think that moderators will want to ban the
        bots, but I think that they will come to prefer them. Because they will be
        making &quot;automated, constructive comments&quot; without ever cursing.
        Mission fucking accomplished: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;810&#x2F;<p>But
        behind the scenes, they can subtly control the narrative. Imagine being outnumbered
        about 1000-1 by bots, in a few years, here and everywhere online, and they&#x27;re
        collaborating and swarming to herd everyone into their desired goal, e.g.
        to pump or dump an asset. Eventually, the bots will simply not care about
        what we humans think. When I was graduating, everyone used Black-Scholes to
        price derivatives, so it became a self-fulfilling prophecy. Every corporation
        started to prefer bots to human traders. It happened with trading, why not
        with content?","time":1671511608,"title":"Ask HN: Has Hacker News already

        was diagnosed with astigmatism in 2018 or around that time. I haven&#x27;t

        or slightly impaired. I did get glasses, which I rarely wear, but I have been
        wearing them more recently because I feel that my eyesight may be becoming
        more of an issue. For example, after long periods of coding or looking at
        my phone screen, I see floaters. Sometimes I wake up seeing them and have
        a low-productivity day or take a nap and some Advil in the hope that it is
        related to a migraine.<p>I am mainly interested in what tools, settings, and
        themes people with astigmatism use, and if you have any preference for light
        or dark themes. Personally, I cannot stand light, whether it is physical light
        or light on screens. When my 5-year-old turns on the overhead light in my
        bedroom, I pull the blanket over my head or shout to turn it off. I feel like
        Gizmo from Gremlins.<p>I am a developer, and my main tools are Terminator
        + Tmux, Chrome, DBeaver, and Visual Studio Code. The font I am using is Jetbrains
        SemiBold. I just tried the Solarized Dark theme and I am kind of liking it,
        but I feel like I might be able to find something slightly better. Before
