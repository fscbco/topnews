# Overall Design
- Article index
  - viewing articles
  - bookmarking articles
  - seeing who else bookmarked an article
- User index
  - viewing users in the system
  - clicking on a user shows all of a user's bookmarks
- Refresh articles - synchronous ActiveJob can take a while to
  complete.  Delayed Job or other background service.
- no ajax, all page refresh

# FetchTopStoriesJob - runs on the following conditions:
- rails initialization
- at top of the hour
- user access to /articles/refresh
- putting this in the initializer makes it synchronous and not ideal,
  better to use background worker
- manual control: `rails console`: `FetchTopStoriesJob.perform_later`

# Testing

```bash
rake db:test:purge
rake db:test:prepare
bundle exec rspec
```

Stuck on FactoryBot and signing in a user for testing.
