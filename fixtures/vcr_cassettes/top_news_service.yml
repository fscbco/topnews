        everyone,<p>i studied philosophy, literature, and law in school and never
        really got a handle on computers, despite my interest<p>but a little over
        a year ago i heard about hackernews<p>i think it was the calm design of the
        site that made me become a regular; within no time, i had strong opinions
        on systemd &amp; sysvinit, on functional &amp; object-oriented programming,
        on emacs &amp; vim (actually i still don&#x27;t yet have a handle on emacs
        but i&#x27;m working on it...)<p>the first thing ya&#x27;ll inspired me to
        do was to set up a matrix instance on a vps to replace whatsapp for my circle
        of friends. it was hard, for me, at first, to set up, but i quickly got addicted
        to the feeling of ownership that came with being the admin. that alone i would
        say is worth a huge thank you, but you&#x27;ve inspired me to do even more:<p>-
        switched to MX Linux as my daily driver<p>- started learning emacs and trying
        to do as much as possible within emacs<p>- built a server from spare parts
        and configured debian from scratch<p>- replaced netflix with jellyfin<p>-
        hosted my urbit and made it accessible via any web browser<p>- set up a minio
        backend for my urbit<p>- replaced spotify with navidrome<p>- hosted a pigallery2
        (for my friend who is a photographer)<p>- created for myself a pseudo-unified
        computing environment using syncthing<p>- everything proxied with caddy<p>just
        today i set up miniflux and https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vasanthv&#x2F;talk<p>i
        look forward to hearing about new projects that i can deploy to improve my
        friends&#x27; lives; i hear about them here<p>but it&#x27;s not even just
        what you&#x27;ve encouraged me to do: once i had my server working i became
        consumed by the idea that i could do it all myself, so i started to try to
        self-host email. you all helped encourage me to give up that nightmare and
        just pay a real company to do it for me<p>this points at maybe what i&#x27;m
        most thankful for: i have a much deeper and more sophisticated understanding
        of the technology stack i interact with at any given time. even if i&#x27;m
        not &quot;in control&quot;, at least knowing <i>how</i> i&#x27;m not in control
        gives a sense of security<p>more than that, i&#x27;m able to impress my nephew,
        a supposed computer genius, by simply regurgitating the latest talking points
        from HN. maybe this is the most valuable benefit i&#x27;ve derived so far....<p>one
        of the other things i&#x27;ve done is to self-host a ghost installation for
        the benefit of my friends, john and borka. they basically live like monks
        for the benefit of the preservation of the amazon rainforest. with HN&#x27;s
        help, i have been able to set them up with a website:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;RioMomon.rhizoma.zone<p>sometimes
        at this time of year people look for something to which to donate. the nice
        thing about rio momon is that all of the money goes directly towards the mission
        (web hosting &amp; web dev costs, for example, are borne by me -- and i am
        able to do it easily, because HN taught me)<p>thank you!","time":1671877794,"title":"Tell

        EOL and give hardware an expiration date - things that aren&#x27;t exactly
        because of less efficiency.<p>So this kinda brings me to my question, is software
        actually becoming less efficient?<p>We have better image&#x2F;video&#x2F;audio
        codes, better multi-core programming languages, better efficiency in various
        high-level programming languages, (sometimes) better optimized libraries,
        better tooling that allow development of more efficient software and also
        pre-trained ML technology that uses much less storage&#x2F;compute than some
        custom crafted software would have allowed.","time":1671839893,"title":"Ask

        HN, we’re Colin and Dima, founders of Metriport (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;metriport.com&#x2F;\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;metriport.com&#x2F;</a>).
        We help digital health companies access and manage user health and medical
        data, through an open-source and universal API. Today we&#x27;re launching
        our open-source Health Devices API, which allows companies to gain access
        to their users’ health data from various wearables, RPM devices, and mHealth
        apps. You can check out the public Github repo here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;metriport&#x2F;metriport\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;metriport&#x2F;metriport</a><p>For
        developers in the health data space, building integrations to various data
        sources is a huge pain, as it means wrangling different data formats, gaining
        access to the APIs in the first place, and ultimately spending precious developer
        resources building out data pipelines. We solve this pain for you through
        our open-source API, which is quick and easy to get started with (see: <a
        href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.metriport.com&#x2F;getting-started&#x2F;connect-quickstart\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.metriport.com&#x2F;getting-started&#x2F;connect-quickstar...</a>).<p>Out
        of the box, our Health Devices API supports integrations with Fitbit, Oura,
        Whoop, Withings, and Cronometer. We plan to add many more, including Garmin,
        Apple Health, and Google Fit in the near term. We work closely with our customers,
        so if there’s an integration you need, we’re more than happy to build it into
        our API. Because we’re open-source, you can also fork our code and build your
        own custom integrations.<p>Getting started is simple. To start getting data
        from your users:<p>1) Create a developer account and generate an API key:
        <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dash.metriport.com&#x2F;\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dash.metriport.com&#x2F;</a><p>2)
        Set up our client on your server and initialize it with your API key: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.metriport.com&#x2F;getting-started&#x2F;connect-quickstart#3-setup-the-metriport-client-on-your-server\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.metriport.com&#x2F;getting-started&#x2F;connect-quickstar...</a><p>3)
        Link the Metriport Connect widget into your app. This pre-built widget makes
        it easy for your users to connect all their data sources into your application.<p>Now
        you’re ready to start accessing your users’ health data from their sources
        they’ve connected.<p>We also offer a hosted SaaS solution with usage-based
        pricing, with no minimum platform fees. We believe this will open doors to
        a wide range of early stage companies and help drive innovation in the digital
        health industry.<p>While we’re excited to be launching this product today
        and be the first open-source Health Devices API of its kind, we’re also really
        looking forward to sharing our Medical API with you in the coming months.
        You can find out more about that here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;metriport.com&#x2F;medical\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;metriport.com&#x2F;medical</a><p>We
        can’t wait to see how this API is used and what it helps companies develop.
        Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions, and happy developing!","time":1671746977,"title":"Show

        come from a Jetbrains background.\nI&#x27;m trying to migrate to VS Code,
        and i&#x27;ve come to appreciate it&#x27;s modularity and the overall quality
        of the extensions.<p>One thing that&#x27;s been bothering, though, is that
        i see very few refactoring options, and they don&#x27;t work reliably.<p>For
        example, i was working with a Typescript project (which is basically the main
        language of the VS Code ecosystem), and when i tried to move a type definition
        to another file, i discovered you only have the option to move it to a new
        file, in the current folder, with the name of symbol. This would mean I&#x27;d
        need to either create a separate file for this type (plus some other symbols
        if i want to) or handle the import and export changing myself.<p>I won&#x27;t
        talk about the error i get if i don&#x27;t select the symbols&#x27; export
        statement, because this is not discussed anywhere and may be something that
        only happens to me.<p>I tried doing this said refactor in Webstorm, and it
        was just a matter of hitting F6 and choosing the target file. I also tried
        searching for refactoring extensions for Typescript, to no avail.<p>This is
        really bothering me, changing import statements manually everytime i want
        to move a symbol sounds like a very tedious task.<p>So, I&#x27;m wondering,
        since a LOT of devs use VS Code, is this just how it is? Do you just get used
        to manually refactoring? I&#x27;m also using the Python extension, and it
        doesn&#x27;t even give me any move refactoring options.","time":1671823039,"title":"Ask

        a senior iOS developer with background at a FAANG etc, so during good times
        it was always very easy to find jobs. Recently I&#x27;ve had some pretty bad
        experiences with two YC companies in a row.<p>In both cases I went through
        long recruitment processes, spoke at length with the founders and technical
        staff, did a (paid) trial project, in one case this lasted for almost a month.
        In both companies everyone I talk to was extremely positive, even gushing,
        so I was not surprised to be hired.<p>I was very surprised though that in
        both cases they changed their minds before the formal employment had begun,
        due to their financial situation.<p>They were never rude, and they did pay
        me for the hours I had worked, but it still wasted a lot of my time since
        I didn&#x27;t seek any other jobs while trial working for them.<p>It&#x27;s
        hard to imagine that it was some kind of ruse to get very short term work
        done, but it&#x27;s also hard to see how they couldn&#x27;t plan better. Perhaps
        they started hiring on the expectation of being able to raise money, but that

        an unemployed mid&#x2F;senior-level developer in the U.S. with a reasonably

        starting this discussion to generate ideas for fallback options for finding
        development work, meaning places that hire quickly but might be low prestige,
        low pay, boring, contract, stuff like that. Recruiters might seem to be an
        answer but I haven&#x27;t had much luck there: very little inbound traffic
        or response to outbound applications. I might just not be using them correctly,

        commute to work 3 days a week for 2.5h more or less each way, and I WFH 2
        days a week.<p>I do not work in IT (Logistics), and this is my first job ever,
        shy of right about 6 months into it. I&#x27;m a 23 year old college dropout.<p>I
        used to live in the city I currently work as, but my landlord just became
        impossible to live with, which left me with a very bad experience of what
        sharing a house is like.<p>At the same time, I experienced some work problems
        which led me to become very anxious when I&#x27;m lonely, and so, I decided
        to go back to live with my parents, which has helped me become more mentally
        stable.<p>However, my 2.5h commute, which consists of Driving to a Train a
        Station (30 min) --&gt; Taking a train (1h) --&gt; Taking the subway (25 min)
        --&gt; Taking a tram (5 Mon) --&gt; Walk to work (5 Mon) (in the best case
        scenario), is making me very mentally exhausted. I wake up to go to work at
        6PM and I get back home at 7.45PM. I go to sleep at 9.45PM.<p>I&#x27;ve tried
        listening to podcasts, but I&#x27;ve found they do not quite work for me.
        Maybe I need better headphones, but in the train, people just talk too loudly
        for them to work.<p>I cannot leave this job because it&#x27;s my sole source
        of income, and I&#x27;m financially stretched (salary is rather low), as well
        as I&#x27;m 6 months into it. Dad tells me every day how proud it is of my
        job and how I should never leave it.<p>Looking for a new place to rent is
        hell, absolute hell. Landlords want to know your work history + income history
        + shady landlords which do not want you to sign contracts leaving you with
        no rights + it would be a huge expense for me. Right now, I ride the aforementioned
        train for free thanks to a government program, so commuting costs me 1&#x2F;7th
        vs. renting.<p>I also have a friend who makes as much money as I do, in IT,
        WFH fully, and is doing so much better than I do. I&#x27;m a CS dropout, and
        I&#x27;m thinking of getting back to it... But I have my doubts.<p>Has anyone

        AI started out as a way for my friends and I to save on our AWS bills for
        weekend side projects - it was a solution to a problem we all had: expensive
        AWS bills. Since then, it’s grown to a company with over 150 clients, 16 employees,
        dozens of new features, and millions in ARR. We’ve grown to support 50+ of
        the top instance types with guaranteed buyback and the dashboard now features
        things like a savings tracker, IAM (multiple users with different permissions),
        multiple AWS accounts, a billing tracker, and the ability to consolidate all
        of your AWS RIs and SPs into a single dashboard. We’re adding new instance
        types with guaranteed buyback every month, to help companies save across the
        board, not only on their AWS bills and SaaS procurement, but across their
        entire tech stack.<p>The best part is that we only make money when we help
        people save; no hidden fees, no long contracts, and hopefully no large bills.
        Users pay a percentage of savings, billed monthly, and can stop using us whenever
        they would like. We became profitable 6 months after launch.<p>But, despite
        product market fit like I’d never seen (everyone likes to save, especially
        on their AWS bills), we didn’t take off immediately. Once I’d onboarded my
        friends from the hackathon circuit, I needed to find a way to bring Usage
        to a larger audience. I started out placing ads on Google, LinkedIn, and Reddit
        and was getting a lot of clicks. We were getting 5,000 site visits a month,
        but conversions were lower than expected. It wasn’t working like I’d hoped.<p>As
        a technical founder I had a problem: I knew that the tool I’d built would
        save companies around 60% on their AWS bills, I just didn’t know how to get
        in front of the right audience.<p>That’s when I made what was one of my best
        decisions: to hire my first salesperson. My advisors told me not to hire him,
        he was a 22 yr old recent grad working as a forklift driver with no sales
        experience, but I went ahead anyways. Both of us started cold calling and
        emailing prospects every morning. After two and a half weeks, we had our first
        client from cold outreach. We started A&#x2F;B testing our messaging, trying
        different approaches and things started taking off. After about a month, we
        were bringing in around 2 new clients a week.<p>That’s when we stumbled into
        our second acquisition channel: partnerships. We were approached by a DevOps
        shop who had dozens of customers and wanted to white label our solution. I
        spent the next weeks working around the clock to build out a partner dashboard
        and API solution. When we integrated, we gained 15 new customers in a week
        with a total of $2m in AWS spend under management. Pretty soon, we were able
        to replicate this channel with other DevOps firms and AWS consultancies.<p>Both
        partnerships and sales took off and soon we were maxxed out making sure we
        could onboard customers without our tool breaking. That’s when we decided
        to double down on both channels. I hired several new sales and partnerships
        people. While there was a steep learning curve for them to master the AWS
        jargon and world of cloud compute our pipeline started to fill up. Today,
        we have over $12m of deals in pipeline and I’m excited to see where things
        go in 2023.<p>Looking back, there was no single thing but a lot of small things
        done right over a year that helped us get to where we are.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usage.ai&#x2F;","time":1671829227,"title":"Tell

        ago I was visiting a local robotics team for a meet and greet. There was an
        adult there acting as the supervision, and the kids were working on getting
        their robot up and running for a demo.  One group was busy on the laptop&#x2F;joysticks.
        Another hand their hands on the robot, adjusting pieces of plexiglass that
        guided balls.  From a small demo moments earlier, I learned that the joysticks
        were VERY sensitive and drove multiple 300 watt motors that drove a chain
        drive for the wheels. The chain was exposed and there were fingers everywhere.
        I had a moment of pause and then I just yelled &quot;STOP&quot;, startling
        everyone including the supervisor who was mid-sentence in conversation with
        me. I slowly unwound the whole situation, turning it into a chat about &quot;culture
        of safety.&quot;<p>I think about this a lot, specifically because there was
        about 2 seconds where my brain thought, &quot;I&#x27;m not in charge here.
        I just met everyone. Do I really speak up? Maybe I&#x27;m missing something
        about all of this.&quot;  After many replays of this scenario over the years,
        I decided that I would rather embarrass myself horribly than hesitate next

        first I was bummed, but quickly realized that even though the output looked
        neat, it was also not reliable (missing some acronyms, adding some that were
        not in the original text, albeit related to it).<p>Anyway, the next day I
        stumbled upon https:&#x2F;&#x2F;killedbygoogle.com and the two things collided
        in my head: other people probably feel like AI is going to &quot;kill&quot;
        them or their product too. Why not make a list of these things?<p>A shameless
        clone later (it&#x27;s open source )  https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deathbyai.com was
        born. I was initially going for a more serious tone, but it soon felt impossible
        to give a fair story for each item in ~5 lines, so I went for something lighter
        and, hopefully, more fun.<p>This is neither an attempt to criticize AI nor
        one to bury its &quot;victims.&quot; On the contrary, I hope this page can
        highlight the potential of AI while showing that the &quot;old ways&quot;
        can still be relevant.<p>Hope you like it. Feedback and contributions are
